    <p><strong>Why does Arcadian Lab collect data from its apps and games?</strong></p>

    <p>When you use the Arcadian Lab Apps and Games, We will collect information about you. Such information, also known as “personal data” can be automatically collected by Arcadian Lab when necessary or voluntarily submitted by you. We use this data to provide you with the app or game that you downloaded, to ensure safety, and for other purposes described below (for instance advertising) in the “More Details” section.</p>

    <p><strong>To run analytics and understand how users interact with our product and services</strong></p>

    <p>(e.g., identifying that a feature is annoying for users or that a level is too difficult for most gamers)</p>

    <p><strong>Legal basis for third party analytics - Express consent.</strong> In the countries where collecting users’ consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations, Arcadian Lab only shares personal data collected through Arcadian Lab apps with third party partners that provide Arcadian Lab with analytics services once you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in our apps.</p>
