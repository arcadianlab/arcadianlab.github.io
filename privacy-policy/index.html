    <h1 class="text-center">Arcadian Lab Games and Apps</h1>
<br>
    <p><strong>Why does Arcadian Lab collect data from its apps and games?</strong></p>

    <p>When you use the Arcadian Lab Apps and Games, We will collect information about you. Such information, also known as “personal data” can be automatically collected by Arcadian Lab when necessary or voluntarily submitted by you. We use this data to provide you with the app or game that you downloaded, to ensure safety, and for other purposes described below.</p>

    <p>When you install and use Arcadian Lab Apps and Games, we can collect and process some of your data for different legitimate purposes.</p>

    <p>You will find below explanations regarding the reasons why Arcadian Lab may collect data and the legal bases Arcadian Lab relies on in each case.</p>

    <p>Arcadian Lab collects data:</p>

    <p><strong><li>To provide you with the services you asked for</li></strong></p>

    <p>(e.g., knowing that you completed the first level to allow access to the second one)</p>

    <p><ul><li>Legal basis – Arcadian Lab’s legitimate interest: such data processing is strictly necessary for the service(s) asked</li></ul></p>

    <p><strong><ul><li>To run analytics and understand how users interact with our product and services in order to continuously improve it either directly or through third party partners</ul></li></strong></p>

    <p>(e.g., identifying that a feature is annoying for users or that a level is too difficult for most gamers)</p>

    <p><ul><li>Legal basis for third party analytics - Express consent. In the countries where collecting users’ consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations, Arcadian Lab only shares personal data collected through Arcadian Lab apps with third party partners that provide Arcadian Lab with analytics services once you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in our apps.</li></ul></p>

    <p><ul><li>Legal basis for first party analytics – Legitimate interest. Arcadian Lab collects user data for the purpose of its own internal analytics tools. Data is used for the sole purpose of Arcadian Lab analytics tool and is not shared with any third parties. This data processing is based on the legitimate interest of Arcadian Lab.</li></ul></p>

    <p><strong><li>To serve advertising tailored to the preference and interests of our users</li></strong></p>

    <p>and allow Arcadian Lab to continue to provide free services and products</p>

    <p><ul><li>Legal basis – Express consent. In the countries where collecting users’ consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations, Arcadian Lab only processes or shares personal data collected through Arcadian Lab apps for personalized advertising purposes once you express your consent through the pop-up notice included in one of our apps.</li></ul></p>

    <p>For all data processing activities that rely on users’ consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time from the “settings” page in our various applications.</p>

    <p>Please only note that in the case where you withdraw your consent or where you refuse to consent in the first place, you will still be served with advertising but that may be less relevant to you as it will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

    <h5><strong>What data does Arcadian Lab collect from its apps and games?</strong></h5>

    <p>Arcadian Lab does not use any data that allows us to identify you directly. We only collect mobile identifiers and other technical information (if necessary, only with your consent) allowing us to recognize your device.</p>

    <p>For all the purposes listed above the data that Arcadian Lab collects is limited to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The apps you are using</li>
        <li>Your IP address</li>
        <li>Your Mobile Advertising ID (Apple IDFA or Google AAID - which are technical identifiers developed by mobile operating systems for advertising purposes which remain under your control and can be reset or erased at any time through your device settings) and device identifier (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices)</li>
        <li>Information about the device you use and your connection (user agent, type of connection, timestamp, system language, device model, screen resolution and settings, battery level, available storage space, time zone, OS)</li>
        <li>Data pertaining to your activities on our applications and notably the way in which you interact with our applications (for instance, how and when you use our applications) and with the advertising served in our applications (for instance, number of ads served, potential clicks)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In some of Arcadian Lab Apps and Games, you may choose to log in to your account with a third-party service (Google or Apple) to improve your experience (sync your progress in multiple devices, secure your progress and restore it in case of device loss, device upgrade, etc.). In such cases, we may collect and securely store your email address (and no other account data) in a hashed format within our database. This information will be used by Arcadian Lab for account recovery and customer support purposes only. We will not share your hashed email with any third party.</p>

    <p><strong><h5>With whom may your data be shared & why?</h5></strong></p>

    <p>We are not selling your personal information, but we need to share it with third parties to deliver the best service possible. Do not worry, we make sure that they all use the same degree of care as We do.</p>

    <p>Arcadian Lab does not share your personal data with

 third parties without your prior consent in the countries where collecting users’ consent may be required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>

    <p>When you consent to the collection of data for advertising and analytics purpose, we may share the data listed above with the following categories of recipients:</p>

    <p><strong>Ad Partners:</strong> that allow us to monetize the ad inventory of our apps and provide users with free products and services.</p>
